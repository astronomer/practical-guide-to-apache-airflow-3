Hello Cosmic Traveler,

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "We must not sit down and wait for miracles. Up and be going!" - John Eliot
2. "Trust in dreams, for in them is the hidden gate to eternity.  " - Kahlil Gibran
3. "Nothing ever happened in the past that can prevent you from being present now; and if the past cannot prevent you from being present now, what power does it have?" - Eckhart Tolle

Have a fantastic journey!
