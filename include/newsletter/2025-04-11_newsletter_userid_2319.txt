Hi Heiner! 

If you venture outside right now in Lipari, you'll find the temperature to be 16.9°C, but it will feel more like 15.5°C. The relative humidity is 66%.

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "The Art of Peace begins with you." - Morihei Ueshiba
2. "To do great work one must be very idle as well as very industrious." - Samuel Butler
3. "I've always tried to go a step past wherever people expected me to end up." - Beverly Sills

This is what Janeway might say to you today:

Heiner, remember that helping others find their
wings is an art in itself, and it starts with you,
like a starship finding its course. Just like you,
the best journeys are those that venture beyond
expectations—sometimes you must pause like a wise
Vulcan, and other times leap forward like a Maquis
on a mission. As you chart your own path, you
carry the resilience and courage of those who
explore the final frontier.

Have a fantastic journey!
