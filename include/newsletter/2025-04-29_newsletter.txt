Hello Cosmic Traveler,

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "The art of being wise is knowing what to overlook." - William James
2. "The farther backward you can look, the farther forward you are likely to see." - Winston Churchill
3. "Resilience is not what happens to you. It's how you react to, respond to, and recover from what happens to you." - Jeffrey Gitomer

Have a fantastic journey!
