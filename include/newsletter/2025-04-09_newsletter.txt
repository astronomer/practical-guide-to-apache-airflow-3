Hello Cosmic Traveler,

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "Anything becomes interesting if you look at it long enough.." - Gustave Flaubert
2. "When the fish is caught we pay no more attention to the trap." - Huang Po
3. "Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking." - Marcus Aurelius

Have a fantastic journey!
