Hello Cosmic Traveler,

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "The Art of Peace begins with you." - Morihei Ueshiba
2. "To do great work one must be very idle as well as very industrious." - Samuel Butler
3. "I've always tried to go a step past wherever people expected me to end up." - Beverly Sills

Have a fantastic journey!
