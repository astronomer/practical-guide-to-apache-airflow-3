Hi Heiner! 

If you venture outside right now in Lipari, you'll find the temperature to be 15.1°C, but it will feel more like 14.6°C. The relative humidity is 51%.

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "Anything becomes interesting if you look at it long enough.." - Gustave Flaubert
2. "When the fish is caught we pay no more attention to the trap." - Huang Po
3. "Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking." - Marcus Aurelius

This is what Picard might say to you today:

Heiner, remember that even when the stars seem
dim, there's always clarity in the universe if you
look long enough. Like discovering a cloaked ship,
the solutions are all within. When you've helped
another find their wings, embrace the journey, not
just the flight. Happiness, my dear friend, is as
simple and profound as commanding the Enterprise—
it's defined by your perspective and resilience.
Make every stardate count, and never underestimate
the power of a good cup of Earl Grey.

Have a fantastic journey!
