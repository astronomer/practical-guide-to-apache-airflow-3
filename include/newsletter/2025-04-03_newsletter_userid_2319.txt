Hi Heiner! 

If you venture outside right now in Lipari, you'll find the temperature to be 15.9°C, but it will feel more like 16.7°C. The relative humidity is 72%.

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "Never confuse a single defeat with a final defeat." - F. Scott Fitzgerald
2. "Why live an ordinary life, when you can live an extraordinary one." - Tony Robbins
3. "Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself." - George Bernard Shaw

Have a fantastic journey!
