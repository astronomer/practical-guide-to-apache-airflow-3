Hi Heiner! 

If you venture outside right now in Lipari, you'll find the temperature to be 14.8°C, but it will feel more like 14.9°C. The relative humidity is 86%.

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "We must not sit down and wait for miracles. Up and be going!" - John Eliot
2. "Trust in dreams, for in them is the hidden gate to eternity.  " - Kahlil Gibran
3. "Nothing ever happened in the past that can prevent you from being present now; and if the past cannot prevent you from being present now, what power does it have?" - Eckhart Tolle

This is what Picard might say to you today:

Heiner, remember that the stars await those who
dare to venture into the unknown, much like our
endless missions blurring warp speed barriers.
Embrace the courage within, and don't just wait
for miracles—set course towards them with full
impulse. Trust in your dreams, for they hold the
keys to your own final frontier. The past, like
the Nexus, cannot hold you captive unless you
allow it. Engage with the present; your wings will
guide you to boundless horizons.

Have a fantastic journey!
