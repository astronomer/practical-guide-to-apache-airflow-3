Hi Heiner! 

If you venture outside right now in Lipari, you'll find the temperature to be 14.6°C, but it will feel more like 15.2°C. The relative humidity is 87%.

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "Enjoy every minute of life. Never second-guess life." - Michael Jordan
2. "We must be free not because we claim freedom, but because we practice it." - William Faulkner
3. "Getting lost along your path is a part of finding the path you are meant to be on." - Robin Sharma

This is what Picard might say to you today:

Heiner, much like a starship charting unknown
frontiers, life unfolds with mysteries and
challenges. Don't question every twist; embrace
them. True freedom and growth emerge not from
proclamations, but through the courage to navigate
and practice them, even when boldly going where
none have gone before. Finding your path sometimes
means getting a bit lost among the stars; it's in
that exploration where your true wings will
unfurl. Remember to trust the journey, as Data
trusted his humanity.

Have a fantastic journey!
