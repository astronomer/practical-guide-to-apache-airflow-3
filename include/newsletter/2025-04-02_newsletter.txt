Hello Cosmic Traveler,

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "Enjoy every minute of life. Never second-guess life." - Michael Jordan
2. "We must be free not because we claim freedom, but because we practice it." - William Faulkner
3. "Getting lost along your path is a part of finding the path you are meant to be on." - Robin Sharma

Have a fantastic journey!
