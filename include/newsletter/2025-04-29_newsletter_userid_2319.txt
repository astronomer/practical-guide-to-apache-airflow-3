Hi Heiner! 

If you venture outside right now in Lipari, you'll find the temperature to be 18.4°C, but it will feel more like 19.9°C. The relative humidity is 79%.

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "The art of being wise is knowing what to overlook." - William James
2. "The farther backward you can look, the farther forward you are likely to see." - Winston Churchill
3. "Resilience is not what happens to you. It's how you react to, respond to, and recover from what happens to you." - Jeffrey Gitomer

This is what Janeway might say to you today:

Heiner, remember that the art of guiding others is
often knowing which challenges to overlook. When
you reflect on your past journeys, you find the
wisdom to carve a path forward. Resilience lies
not in what life throws your way, but in how you
rise and adapt, much like a starship navigating
through turbulent space. Keep helping others find
their wings, just as you helped our crew navigate
through the Delta Quadrant with unwavering
strength.

Have a fantastic journey!
