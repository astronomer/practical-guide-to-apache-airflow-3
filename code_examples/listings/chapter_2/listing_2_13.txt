Hi Heiner! 

If you venture outside right now in Lipari, 
you'll find the temperature to be 15.4°C, 
but it will feel more like 14.8°C. 
The relative humidity is 68%.

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "Only by acceptance of the past, can you alter it." -
   T.S. Eliot
2. "A man is but a product of his thoughts. 
   What he thinks he becomes." - Mahatma Gandhi
3. "The future belongs to those who believe in the 
   beauty of their dreams." - Eleanor Roosevelt

Have a fantastic journey!
