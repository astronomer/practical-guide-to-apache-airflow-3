Hello Cosmic Traveler,

As you surf the probabilistic waves of existence today, 
take these three quotes with you:

1. "Paths are made by walking." - Franz Kafka
2. "Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood." - Marie Curie
3. "The future belongs to those who believe in the 
   beauty of their dreams." - Eleanor Roosevelt

Have a fantastic journey!
