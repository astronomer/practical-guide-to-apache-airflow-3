Listing 1.2: Code structure of the asset-oriented approach

Simple ETL pipeline created using 3 assets.
Each asset defines one dag with one task that materializes the asset.
The assets do not pass data between them, see listing_1_2_passing_data_version.py
for an example of passing data between assets.
